# Vite with the Ionic tabs starter

Fork and clone to dive in to your project.

## Why?

The prod build using vue-cli is **3MB**, while the build with VITE is **413KB** (86% smaller)!

Also, the dev live reload times are super-much quicklier with VITE. ⚡️

## Start it up

> `npm run serve`

## Run unit and e2e tests

> `npm run test`
>
> `npm run coverage`
> 
> `npm run e2e`

## Prod build
